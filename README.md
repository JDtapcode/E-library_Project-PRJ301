# Conclusion and Discussion

## The pros and cons of your application:

### Pros:

 The application boasts a simple and user-friendly interface, facilitating easy navigation. It allows users to read books online and meets the core requirements of the product.

 High accessibility makes it suitable for a wide range of users. The admin's ability to upload books ensures immediate visibility to readers, enhancing the platform's popularity.

### Cons:

 The application is relatively basic and lacks many features. The "Read online" function experiences delays after being initiated. Validation of input fields remains incomplete, compromising user experience.

 Additionally, the interface lacks sophistication and does not possess any distinctive features.

 The library has a limited number of books.

## What 've learned during developing of your application:

 Starting a web application deployment: Initiating a web application requires careful preparation and a clear decision on the initial direction. We've learned how to determine the starting point and the necessary steps to kickstart the project.

 Potential issues when transitioning from theory to practical implementation: We realized that implementing ideas from theory to practice isn't always straightforward. There might be various unexpected difficulties and challenges when moving from the planning phase to actual execution.

 Handling individual errors and effective teamwork: We've learned how to handle individual issues and errors more efficiently. Additionally, we've grasped how to effectively work as a team, creating favorable conditions for each member to maximize their potential.

 Continuous adjustments and improvements guided by instructors: We've learned to flexibly adjust and enhance the product based on guidance and suggestions from instructors or mentors. This has helped us progress and adapt swiftly.

 Utilizing personal GitHub and crafting descriptions on GitHub: We've approached and learned to use GitHub for personal purposes and how to design effective information descriptions on GitHub.

### These experiences have been pivotal, offering us a deeper understanding of the software development process and how to continuously enhance our progress within our project.

## We have brainstormed several ideas to enhance the application in the future:

 Add more books to the bookshelves.

 Redesign the layout interface to minimize excessive whitespace in BookDetails.

 Complete the Book Update feature.

 Introduce new functionalities such as 'Add to Shelf' for users to bookmark books they want to read or are currently reading, 'Buy Online' to provide links to where the book is available for purchase on e-commerce platforms, 'Account Management' to enable users to update their information, and a feature to sort books by genre,ratings function based on readers' feedback after reading."
